            <h2>Images of UMass that I enjoy</h2>

            <h3>Campus Pond</h3>
            <p>The center of campus looks very nice in the summertime, as highlighted by this photo of a glistening campus pond and green grass.</p>

           <h3>Library</h3>
            <p>The campus also looks beautiful at night, especially with the library serving as the campus' North Star, like in this photo.</p>

            <h3>Dining Hall</h3>
            <p>This photo that I took perfectly captures the environment of Worcester Dining Commons during busy hours.</p>
